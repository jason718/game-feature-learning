## Prerequisites
- Pytorch-0.4 (some evaluation code borrowed from other places requiring Caffe)
- Python2 (One evaluation code requiring Python3)
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN (Sorry no CPU version)

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install PyTorch 0.4 and torchvision from http://pytorch.org
- Python packages
    - torchvision
    - numpy
    - opencv
    - tensorflow (necesary for the use of tensorboard. Will change it to tensorboardX)
    - scikit-image
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jason718/game-feature-learning
cd game-feature-learning
```
- Change the config files under configs.

### Pre-trained models:
- Caffemodel(Caffenet): Coming in second update
- Pytorch model: Coming in second update

Since I greatly changed the code structure, I am retraining using the new code to reproduce the paper results.

### Dataset:
   - SUNCG: Download the SUNCG images from [suncg website](http://suncg.cs.princeton.edu/).
        And make sure to put the files as the following structure:
        ```
            suncg_image
            ├── depth
               ├── room_id1
               ├── ...
            ├── normal
               ├── room_id1
               ├── ...
            ├── edge
               ├── room_id1
               ├── ...
            └── lab
                ├── room_id1
                ├── ...
        ```

   - SceneNet: Download the SceneNet images from [scenenet website](https://robotvault.bitbucket.io/scenenet-rgbd.html).
         And make sure to put the files as the following structure:
        ```
            scenenet_image
            └── train
               ├── 1
               ├── 2
               ├── ...
        ```
     Please check scripts/surface_normals_code to generate surface normals from depth maps.
- Dataset For Domain Adaptation:
    - Places-365: Download the Places images from [places website](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/).
    - Or you can choose other dataset for DA such ImageNet...

### Train/Test
- Train a model:
```bash
sh ./scripts/train.sh
```
- Evaluate on feature learning
  - Read each README.md under folder "eval-3rd-party"
  
- Evaluate on three tasks
    - Coming in Third Update


## Useful Resources
There are lots of awesome papers studying self-supervision for various tasks such as Image/Video Representation learning,
Reinforcement learning, and Robotics. I am maintaining a paper list [[awesome-self-supervised-learning]](https://github.com/jason718/awesome-self-supervised-learning) on Github. You are more than welcome to contribute and share :) 

Supervised Learning is awesome but limited. Un-/Self-supervised learning generalizes better and sometimes 
also works better (which is already true in some geometry tasks)!
